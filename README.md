# Project Title
Create Javascript code to generate financial analysis

# Description
In this challenge, I was required to use the concepts I have learned during the bootcamp so far on Javascript to complete the required activity. The activity focused on a real-world situation. I was required to create code that would be used for analyzing the financial records of a company. 

   
I decided to create several variables by using VAR so that I could then write code using FOR loops to generate the answers that I needed. My first FOR loop checked the length of the dataset. 

It contained 86 records so that gave me the answer 86 for total months included. Within this I created code to tell me the total sum of both the profit and loss data fields. 

I then used another FOR loop to work out the average changes in profit and loss over the entire period. However the average total I got was different to the requirements. 

# Getting Started
To help get started we were provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file.
I used the dataset to generate certain outcomes based on the requirements ReadMe file. 
Firstly I created a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`. Then, cloned it to my computer. I then copied the starter files to my local git repository.

I used VS code 
Git Hub 
HTML 

# Help
I had several problems with this project and found it quite difficult. I continually get an error message when trying to commit to git hub. This error message prevents me from regularly commiting at different stages to show the progress that I make. I clearly lack the knowledge to be able to work out the issues I faced. 

Finally, I was required to create code to find the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period and the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period. Unfortunately, I could not complete this section as I dont know how to create the code required despite several attempts to find the answer online, help from a tutor and ask BCS.
